# Homework 2 - Services

For the solution, I created a service that receives a boolean to turn a navigation system on or off based on the value of the boolean (1 = on and 0 = off). The service responds to the client with a corresponding message reflecting the state of the navigation system. The client operates based on user input, prompting the user to enter 1, 0, or 'q' to quit.
