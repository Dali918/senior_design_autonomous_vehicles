INT. ROOM – NIGHT
Black. The unsteady POV of someone groping through a darkened room,
hands out ahead—
Bang! A wall.
The figure we’re following wasn’t expecting that. Hands flat against the
wall – hand over hand. Looking for an opening.
LOGAN

Where am I?
Where are we? A prison cell? A maze?
Where the fuck am I?
Okay. Here’s the opening our figure was seeking—

MARCIA
(off )

Logan? It’s okay, Logan.
Our guy is in somewhere now, into the room he was seeking. Okay.
Everything is okay. He knows what he’s doing now—

LOGAN
(to himself )

Ugh. Okay. Okay.
The shuffle of bedclothes as Marcia climbs out of bed.
Then we hear the sound of ... what? Water dripping? On to something
soft—
And then boom—
Lights on! And all is bright and stark and sudden. And what do we have?
An eighty-year-old man, Logan Roy, in his shorts and T-shirt pissing
towards a laundry basket in a walk-in wardrobe lined with freshly
arrived suits and shirts.
Dark urine stutters across the deep white pile of the thick carpet,
dampening it down like hot piss on wet snow.

Logan is momentarily terrified. But then a younger woman, early fifties,
is in the doorway – her hands across her nakedness – pulling something
on—

MARCIA

It’s okay.

LOGAN

Where am I?

MARCIA

It’s okay. We’re in the new place. It’s okay, Logan.
NEW YORK. 4:12 A.M.
He computes this information as we cut from Logan’s rebooting face to—
INT. CORPORATE BRIEFING ROOM – DAY
Logan Roy’s face again. But confident. On a screen: a corporate
headshot.

CORPORATE
(voice-over)

Waystar Royco is a family. A family that spans four continents, fifty
countries, three divisions: Entertainment, News and Resorts. Working
together. To provide a net that can hold the world, or catapult it
forward. To the next adventure!
TORONTO. 7:15 A.M.
Greg (early twenties) in the front row, is nodding, pretending to be
engaged. But he’s zoning out and when he blinks—
INT. CAR – DAY
We cut through images of the recent past from Greg’s POV—
He’s smoking a hit of weed in a little pot pipe.
EXT. PARKING LOT – DAY
He slams shut the door of his small car in a big empty parking lot.
Fumbles his keys. Sweating. Anxious.

INT. CORPORATE BRIEFING ROOM – DAY
He’s back in the room. On the corporate message, a selection of Waystar
holdings appear on screen:
The logo of a movie studio: Waystar Studios—
A selection of provincial Canadian and US local newspapers—
A US TV network: ATN and some cable channels, all their logos on
screen at once in boxes: News, Cooking, Music, Spanish Language,
Comedy Reruns, Sports (Ultimate Frisbee)—
A USA Today-style national US paper: The Correspondent—
Some mastheads of big-city and UK papers: Chicago Daily—
And finally the theme-park franchise: ‘Waystar Studios Adventure’. With
parks in California, outside London, and pinging on the onscreen map,
Toronto.
On screen appears Kendall Roy.
He’s chyroned: ‘Kendall Roy, Divisional President’.

KENDALL

Joining Waystar Royco you’re joining one of the most dynamic news
and entertainment companies in the world. Feel it!
After the ‘Feel it!’ graphic there’s a TM.
The trainer pauses the DVD on the graphic.
TRAINER
How we feeling. Ready to go?
Nods from the assembled trainees. But the trainer spots Greg is zoning
out. Focusses in on him—
Okay? You in the room?

GREG

Uh-huh. Yep.

TRAINER
And who are you playing today?
GREG
(by rote)

I’m not playing anyone. I am Doderick.
TRAINER

And Doderick is?

GREG

Doderick is mild-mannered to a fault. Puppyish in my enthusiasms.
Playful, eager and lacking in guile. I am the best friend to all I meet.
The trainer nods. Correct. Good kid. Looks to the manager at the back of
the room.

TRAINER

Okay. Let’s go, folks!
Greg takes a last look at Kendall paused on screen as we—
INT. LIMO – DAY
Kendall is hyping himself up for a deal. ‘An Open Letter to NYC’ by the
Beastie Boys plays.
This is his routine when he needs to pep himself up – listening to this
track and throwing punches at the back of the seat in front of him.

KENDALL
(rhyming along)
Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten
From the Battery to the tip of Manhattan
Asian, Middle Eastern and Latin,
Black, White, New York, you make it happen!
Boom. The final punch connects very firmly and rocks the driver in front
sharply.
Apologies, Fikret.
The limo pulls up outside an investment bank’s offices. He gets out onto
the plaza.
NEW YORK. 8:30 A.M.
As he hurries to the doors, Kendall lights a red Marlboro. Takes one
single drag which is all he has time for before entering, stubs it. Walks
into the big lobby.

INT. INVESTMENT BANK – MEETING ROOM – DAY
Kendall is arriving outside the key meeting room. Nods to senior family
advisor, and Chief Operating Officer, Francis Alfred (sixties), who is
waiting for him.

KENDALL

Yeah?
Frank nods. They head in. A bunch of execs and advisors, including the
CFO and advisor to CFO, Alessandro.
As he sits, Kendall attempts a bit of grandstanding icebreaking with
Lawrence, the founder of the target firm, Vaulter.
Hey hey hey, man! Good to see you. So. Where are we? Are we ready
to fuck or what?
There’s a ripple in the room. Some smiles. The curse word doesn’t offend.
But nor does it land to make him the alpha male he’d like. On the other
side of the table, Lawrence leaves Kendall hanging after his big
entrance, listening to the words of an advisor and looking at his phone.

LAWRENCE

Yeah. Okay. Look. I’m really sorry. But it looks like there’s an issue.

KENDALL
How do you mean, dude? I’m here?
LAWRENCE

Yeah I’m sorry, but we’ve been looking at the offer, while you were in
transit, I mean really looking at it.
KENDALL

What, before you didn’t have your glasses on? You were smelling it?
Huh? I got the call.
Kendall looks at Frank.

LAWRENCE
I’m sorry, but it won’t fly – with my board.
KENDALL

I was told it did?

LAWRENCE
Yeah well it won’t. Not this actual number.
KENDALL

I came all the way down here, dude?
LAWRENCE

Well, I’m sorry, ‘dude’.
Kendall tries to sniff out what the issue might be here—

KENDALL

You know I love what you do. That’s been made clear? I’d love to
keep you and your team in place, Lawrence? I love Vaulter.

LAWRENCE

Sure. I just think bottom line, I can deliver a lot more value for our
shareholders. Hope I haven’t inconvenienced you?

KENDALL

I see you. I see this.
Lawrence rises.

LAWRENCE

We’re grateful for your interest in our little outfit, but I think that’s it.
INT. INVESTMENT BANK – CORRIDOR – DAY
Lawrence walks – Kendall catches up. But then—
LAWRENCE
(whispers)

You got the message? I am not letting you Neanderthals in to rape my
company. Ever.
Kendall looks around, can’t quite believe what he’s hearing. But recovers
his composure—
You’re a bunch of bloated dinosaurs who didn’t even notice the
monkeys swinging by till yesterday. Well fuck you, daddy’s boy.

KENDALL
(water off my back)

Oh what? Please.
They reach the elevator area. Their staffs catch up. Now Lawrence
speaks loud enough that the last of this is certainly heard by the wider
group—

LAWRENCE

I’ve got a track record from founding one of the most exciting new-
media brands in the world. What have you got? Track marks from

shooting junk?
His team and Kendall’s react – mostly by avoiding eye contact, though it
would be plausible for Lawrence to deny he intended for his talk to be
‘public’.
But now he switches to public mode—
Thanks for coming down. Great to meet you. Sorry this isn’t going to
work out.

KENDALL

It’s going to work out.

LAWRENCE

No it isn’t.
Kendall can’t think of a way to come back that doesn’t sound ludicrous.
Lawrence and team hang by the elevators. It takes a while longer than
anyone would want. Silence. Then the elevator arrives.
Lawrence and his team head in. Elevator doors close. Kendall lets his
guys assemble around him.

KENDALL

What the fuck? Frank. How did this happen? How can we sweeten
this?

FRANK

You still want to pursue it?

KENDALL

Of course I want to pursue. I want to announce. This is part of the
whole thing. Our offer is fucking good right?
Alessandro looks at a banker, then offers—
ALESSANDRO
You want to bump the offer another point?
Kendall looks at Frank. Alessandro sees a flicker of indecision—
You wanna call your dad?
Kendall looks like someone’s punched him in the nuts but he refuses to
react.

KENDALL

Do I want to call my dad? No I don’t want to call my dad. Do you
want to call your dad?
Is that a real question? From the length of time it hangs, evidently, yes.

ALESSANDRO

No.

KENDALL
Does anyone want to call their dad?
Silence.
No one wants to talk to a dad. Good. Okay, so, we’ve started so let’s
buy this fucking company? I’m pushing the bid to one-twenty. Okay?

ALESSANDRO

Okay.
Kendall’s phone goes. He checks the incoming name. Nods for everyone
else to head in to the elevator. Watches them pass. Then answers—
INT. LOGAN’S APARTMENT – OFFICE – DAY
Logan is in a chair at his desk. There are boxes with files in the room,
still to be unpacked.

LOGAN
How’s it going? Did you close?
At the sound of his dad’s voice there’s a quaver of tightness.
Intercut with:

INT. INVESTMENT BANK – CORRIDOR – DAY
KENDALL

I’m right in the middle, Dad.

(full of inch-deep confidence)

Yes it’s okay! We’re not quite closed. I’m going to one-twenty.
Silence from Logan. Kendall waits, then isn’t going to bite.
So that’s good. And are we still on for the announcement?

LOGAN

Uh-huh.

KENDALL

Great, cos obviously I’m soft floating to like Frank and Rava? And
there’s obviously gossip getting soft floated.
LOGAN

By who?
By Kendall.

KENDALL

By the ether. I don’t know.
Logan gives a non-committal growl, taps on his mouse.
Well look, happy birthday, old geezer! It’s exciting. This is going to
be great for you, Dad.

LOGAN
(not excited)

I’m excited.
Phone down. Logan clicks again.
(shouts)

Marcy!
Marcia is there.
I thought this whole place was going to be ready? Have they fucked
us on the internet because—? My emails—
(mumbling to himself)

I’m going to call, Ellison or Gates because my emails are—
He opens a drawer.
Pencil! Where’s a—?

(mumbled)

(fucking pencil in this whole new set-up, it’s ridiculous!)
He gets up and starts looking in random boxes for a pencil. Marcia looks
at his email account.

MARCIA

I think it’s all up, Logan?

LOGAN

I’m not getting anything. Who do they think I am? Uncle Fuck. It’s
not working, I’m not paying until—
The ding of an email.

MARCIA

I think maybe you just didn’t get an email for like ten minutes?

LOGAN

Uh-huh.

(that sinks in)

Okay.

(finds a pen)

He’s started floating. That wasn’t the arrangement. He’s offering one-
twenty. He’s got a hard-on.

Marcia takes that in.
You don’t walk around with a hard-on. Makes you look ridiculous.

(mumbling to himself as he taps the keyboard)
Get it trapped in the eye of the fucking Halloween pumpkin.
She’s got another preoccupation—
MARCIA

But the me thing? You’re okay on the me thing?

LOGAN
I’m on it, Marcia, don’t worry.
MARCIA

I mean not that I mind?

LOGAN

I do.

MARCIA

This is going to be great for us though. Did you see the brochure I
sent? The Galapagos thing?

LOGAN

Oh, yeah? Great. Turtles, all kinds of disgusting shit. Terrific.
She has some envelopes.

MARCIA

A lot more cards? Presidents, prime ministers, royal crests.

He looks at a PDF of a paper on his screen, scrolling through the pages.
Ignores the cards.

LOGAN

Just have Jan log them—

(gets up)

so I can see which fuckers have dropped me already.
She kisses him. He’s a tough old bastard, and not of a generation to melt
and kiss.
Marcia—

MARCIA

What?

LOGAN

Look I’m not about to spill my guts like some queer. But you know.

(looks at her, doesn’t say it)

(I love you.)

MARCIA

Thank you. I love you too.

Marcia exits. But he’s already on the phone. Looking at a PDF of a front-
page mock-up.

EXT. WASHINGTON, DC – UPMARKET SHOPPING STREET – DAY
This is a street of jewelers, fine-art dealers, boutiques with buzzers to
gain entry.
Tom is scanning windows anxiously as Shiv (Logan’s youngest) talks to
an assistant, Sarah. Nearby they have a black Mercedes parked up.

SHIV

I’ll be back by Sunday night so I’ll look at his speech with him then,
okay?
WASHINGTON, DC. 9:15 A.M.

SARAH

Okay but his office wants the poll numbers by the prekend.

SHIV

By the ‘prekend’? What the fuck’s the prekend?
Tom is looking at a painting, but earwigging on Shiv.

TOM

The prekend is Friday.

SHIV

If he wants them by Friday can he not say Friday?

TOM

Thursday lunch to Friday p.m. is the prekend.

SHIV

Fine. Get Rennie to put them together. Okay?
Sarah says her farewell and heads off. Tom stares into a window.

TOM
Ugh. This is a fucking disaster.
Shiv is looking at her phone, focussed on sending an email.
Shiv? Can you— I need to strategize my gift?
She comes over.
What can I give him he’ll love?
SHIV

I don’t know, my dad doesn’t really like – things.

TOM

He doesn’t like ‘things’?

SHIV

Not really, no.

TOM

Ugh! It needs to say, I respect you, but I’m not awed by you. Start a
fresh chapter. What says that?
SHIV

A pen.

TOM

A pen?
Is a pen the secret? The answer? She smiles, he sees she’s fucking with
him.

SHIV

Tom, every gift he gets will mean an equal amount of nothing to him.
Just make sure it looks like ten to fifteen grand’s worth and you’re

good.
As they look at a watch in the sparsely merchandized window of an
upmarket jewelers, Tom is still not quite convinced all will be well.
EXT. THEME PARK – DAY
Greg’s POV: looking out through Doderick’s wide eyes.
Inside, he’s stoned out of his gourd. He’s hot, he’s bothered. He can’t see
out too well. Breathing hard.
In a wider shot we see Greg in his Doderick costume mimicking the
cartoon character’s loping walk.
A gang of kids on a birthday party are suddenly calling him over. One
starts to cheerfully pull on his tail. Greg has to remain in character and
hop around playfully. Making a cheerful game of remonstrations, shaking
a comedy fist at these pesky kids.
But inside he’s getting dizzy.
From outside: the kids want to be chased. They’re running round and
round in circles—
Inside. Sweat. Disorientation. He’s going in tighter and tighter circles.
Man is he stoned! He can’t see straight—
Until. Spin out. The world’s moving fast round his head. Oh no! Uh-oh.
Here it comes ...
In a wider shot: we see Doderick bend double. A kid jumps on his back,
taking the bend as an invitation. Puke starts to come out through
Doderick’s eyeholes.
Some of the kids back away. Some are kind of fascinated.

KID AT THEME PARK
Ewwww! He’s puking out of his eyes!
Greg retches for quite a while. Another kid pulls his tail again, which
makes Greg hiss—

GREG
(quietly)

Fuck off.

Theme-park helpers rush to pull the incongruous figure out of sight. Greg
is clawing at the costume head.

THEME-PARK ATTENDANT
(on walkie-talkie)

Protein spill.

(to Greg)
Head stays on! Head stays on!
EXT. THEME PARK – DAY
Outside – in the thin winter light, Greg is on his cellphone. He’s woken
his mom, Marianne, in LA.

MARIANNE
Greg? Are you okay? How’s it going?
GREG

Going great.

MARIANNE

Uh-huh, so why are you calling me at six-thirty in the morning?

GREG

Yeah, great but also – Mom, sorry but I screwed up. Well not me – but
look, a, a – kid smoked a joint in my car.
MARIANNE

‘A kid’?

GREG

Yeah. Some ‘nutball’ – a hitchhiker – I picked up, like an idiot
because it was raining, and I thought they might get – sexually
assaulted if I didn’t, maybe, well more fool me! Because he – he gets
in and before I can say anything, he whips out this HUGE doobie, and
I’m like GET OUT, man. And he won’t. He just aggressively smokes
out this whole blunt, on my time, and I’m saying, ‘No! I have an
important first day at a management-training program of a leading
theme-park operator’ and he’s just smiling this – stoned grin – and I
can hardly see the freeway exit because of the dense plumes of toxic
smoke and – and—

MARIANNE

Uh-huh?

GREG

And so, if you can believe it, the car smelt like skunk weed, and I
guess I smelt like – well you can see from there, how I got implicated
in this kind of tragic misunderstanding?
MARIANNE
Did you – tell them – who you are?
GREG

No. No. I thought – no. I didn’t want to be an asshole. Or – get into it
all. I don’t know.

(beat)

I liked it. I’m sorry, Mom, I’m such a fucking screw-up!

MARIANNE

Okay. Listen to me, here’s what you’re going to do—
INT. WAYSTAR – KENDALL’S OFFICE BREAKOUT – DAY
In the meeting room off Kendall’s office, the Waystar team are trying to
figure out how to buy Vaulter. A selection of takeout containers are across
the table. Frank is on the phone.
FRANK

Okay. Uh-huh.
Frank looks at Kendall who is all antsy—
KENDALL

What?
Frank is nodding.
What do they say to one-twenty?
Frank puts his hand over the phone.
FRANK

They’re not going to budge unless it gets to be a stupid number.

KENDALL

What’s a stupid number?

FRANK

What’s a stupid number?

(beat)

A badillion? I don’t know.

KENDALL

Because one-twenty is stupid.
Frank hangs up.

FRANK

Look, I think this is clearly about Lawrence. Should we look at his
package?
Kendall spots a guy arriving.

KENDALL
Okay. Who’s this? Is this news?
The room stirs.

BUSINESS ALCHEMIST

Hi, Kendall Roy?

KENDALL

Hello?
The business alchemist opens his briefcase.
BUSINESS ALCHEMIST
I was sent by – Roman. To burn some sage?
In there are bunches of dried herbs. Essential oils.

KENDALL

Excuse me?

BUSINESS ALCHEMIST

It’s auspicious? I’m a business alchemist. It’s a gift, from your
brother.
He has a bunch of sage pulled out.
FRANK
Will it set off the smoke alarms?

BUSINESS ALCHEMIST

Not usually.

KENDALL

‘Not usually’?

FRANK

Yeah, we’re looking at a billion-dollar acquisition so I think we’ll
need a little more reassurance before we break it up with a building
evacuation?

Just then, Roman Roy, thirty-eight, tanned and taut, ready to roll, arrives.
Uppity and ready to shoot his mouth off.
ROMAN

Hey hey hey, motherfuckers!

KENDALL

Roman.
He goes to hug his brother. Roman nods to the alchemist.

ROMAN

My guy?

(to the alchemist)

Are you saging?

FRANK
We’re just concerned about the alarm?
ROMAN

Right, bad juju. Maybe you should make a move, dude?

BUSINESS ALCHEMIST

I can use essential oils?

ROMAN

I think just fuck off thanks.

(to the room)

How’s it going?
The business alchemist starts to pack up his kit.
KENDALL
Good. Just finessing. You okay, man?
ROMAN

Of course I’m okay. Obviously I’m okay. Why do you ask?
Kendall motions: Are you okay back amongst all this?
What here? Oh, man, I’m so over all this. I was a bad fit. I was never
a corporate cock-suck anyway. Besides. I never got this high in the
fucking building! They stuck me in LA with Old Father Time, we
were the pool boys, right, Frank. Fucking banana cabana?
Frank smiles – about all the good times they (didn’t) share.
So. What’s the bid?

Everyone looks around. Roman’s overstepping the mark. He’s no longer
an insider—

KENDALL

Well—
He doesn’t want to say.

ROMAN

What that’s ‘commercially sensitive’ – I’m still on the board, bro!

KENDALL

Going one-twenty-five.

ROMAN

One-twenty-five! Fuck!?

KENDALL

What? High or low?
Roman isn’t about to put himself out there by pinning down just what his
skepticism implies—

ROMAN

Whatever! For Vaulter? Bit of content and a brand name?

(laughs)
Your funeral. You’ll be captain soon enough.
Kendall looks round the room: Shush.
Oh c’mon, every intern on the Street knows you’re stepping up.
Congrats, man, congrats.

(beat)

So pleased to be out. The company was essentially a cage to me. Well,
congrats. I ought to head.
He looks around and chuckles, and starts to exit.
Look at all this fucking bullshit!
INT. LOGAN’S HOME – DAY
Logan walks the unfamiliar rooms of his large new apartment. Caterers
are arriving with drink and food. Marcia is directing operations.
In the walk-in wardrobe Logan sees a maid with a bucket of water
rubbing at the white carpet with a sponge to remove the urine stain.

He doesn’t acknowledge her but walks to the living area. He tries to sit
down on a couch. This is almost a test for him. Can he ‘sit on a couch’
and ‘relax’ like a regular human being might?
He looks at a magazine story – ‘The Heir with the Flair’ – and its picture
of his son Kendall. After a few beats of trying to read, trying to sip coffee,
he’s up.

LOGAN
Marcy, I’m heading out, as ordered.
MARCIA

Great, till one should be—

LOGAN

Fine – but just here – yeah?

(motions to where he wants people)

I don’t want to get a fucking heart attack from the surprise. Have them
here. And not too loud. Just – a—
MARCIA

You want me to email you the exact details of the surprise?
They share a smile as he goes to exit.
INT. PRIVATE JET – DAY
Shiv and Tom are watching movies. Shiv looking at a laptop. Tom snaps
open the expensive watch box. Hmmm. Is it okay?
INT. AIRPLANE – DAY
In another plane. Economy. Greg bangs his knees as he swivels to get
comfy with insufficient legroom.
INT. WAYSTAR – KENDALL’S OFFICE BREAKOUT – DAY
The room is still full of tired advisors. Most people have finished but
Kendall is still picking at breakfast. He reviews some papers as he eats
from a second breakfast burrito, big bites. His appetites are not quite
under control. He eats, pushes it away, then picks it up again and
demolishes more.

Without knocking, Logan enters. He watches his son for a beat as others
in the room clock Logan. Kendall notices the shift in temperature, looks
up and, as ever, feels obscurely judged. He chews fast—

KENDALL

Dad?

LOGAN

How’s it going?
Everyone sits up, adjusting not-too-unsubtly to the new centre of gravity
in the room.

KENDALL

Fine. Good. Why are you—?

(shuffling Logan into a private space and volume)

Are we okay?

LOGAN

Oh yeah. Yeah. I just have some paperwork—
KENDALL

Ahead of the announcement?
Logan lays papers on the table. Logan sweeps the room. Clocks Frank.
Gives him a wink. Looks over at Alessandro, smiles.

LOGAN

For putting Marcy on the trust. Just bullshit. But I felt like checking
in.

KENDALL

Oh. Because on my announcement, what’s the precise timing on that?

LOGAN
Let’s see how this goes and I can lay it out.
Kendall scans the headings on the papers.
KENDALL
Okay? So this is just the trust?

(whispering to keep this private)

It doesn’t affect me stepping up?
LOGAN
Nuh. I think I told you about—
Someone’s cellphone goes. Kendall looks over. It’s not news.

KENDALL
Dad – I’m busy, do I need to lawyer all this?
LOGAN
(no)

It’s housekeeping.
Logan hands him a pen. Beat between them. Can son trust father? The
father clearly wants this – and the son wants to be liked, to demonstrate
his trust—
Logan is making an assessment too. Kendall takes the pen.

KENDALL

Fine. Marcy’s fine by me. I mean the others, might not feel the same?

LOGAN

I’ll deal with that.
Fuck it. Kendall is all in – signs.
Okay. So – I’ll see you in—?

KENDALL

Yeah look, Dad, on lunch. I really want to be with you but the deal—
He motions to the room: The deal, it’s complicated.

LOGAN
If you need to stay, you need to stay.
A difficult balance. Kendall tries to read his dad.
KENDALL

I really want to be with you?

LOGAN

I appreciate it.

KENDALL

It’s just, delicate. I mean they can handle it but—
Kendall waits for a hint. But Logan gives him no steer.

LOGAN

Son, your call. It’s just – priorities. There’ll be plenty more.
True? Or passive-aggressive? Kendall sort of wants his dad to tell him
what to do, but doesn’t want to ask for direction.

INT. TAXI – NEW YORK – DAY
Greg in a decrepit New York yellow cab. ATN News is playing on the taxi
television screen. A bit of promotional graphics play as a voice
announces—

ANNOUNCER

ATN News is provided as a complimentary service in this taxi cab by
Waystar Royco. ATN News: Trusted and True.
Then on screen – our anchors are behind a desk.
MALE ANCHOR

‘The internet of things.’ Ever wonder what exactly it means? Well
what it could mean is your refrigerator getting transformed into a
lethal weapon that could be turned against you.
FEMALE ANCHOR

That’s one of the terrifying possibilities we’ll be considering in the
next hour as we take a closer look at the technology which is going to
dominate the next one hundred years.
MALE ANCHOR

But before that, coming up in just a moment, we’ll be giving you an
update on all today’s breaking news.
FEMALE ANCHOR

But first, we’re talking immigration to our panel of experts and
asking: After all the tough talk, is it finally times for action?

MALE ANCHOR

Yup, some congressional leaders are suggesting that recent strong
rhetoric on illegal immigration is nothing but a smokescreen. And
asking if it isn’t finally time for the gloves to come off when it comes
to undocumented workers?

FEMALE ANCHOR

Plus deficit talk. Is government borrowing getting so far out of control
radical new measures need to be considered to curb it?

MALE ANCHOR

All that, coming up.
EXT. CENTRAL PARK – DAY

Logan walks, killing time, pretty slowly, through Central Park. Ahead is a
security guy/driver. Behind, Logan’s minder, Colin.
Logan is alone. Maybe shuffles his feet to be super-sure not to slip.
He sits on a bench and Colin hands him a wedge of newspapers – US,
UK and Canadian. Five papers – all owned by Logan.
He starts to examine the pages, layout, pictures and choice of stories in
each one.
He’s on a quiet stretch of path. A young couple pass by. It’s hard for them
to tell what exactly he is? This elderly man with a big pile of papers.
Hobo, or eccentric millionaire?
INT. WAYSTAR – KENDALL’S OFFICE BREAKOUT – DAY
Kendall has made a decision. He is about ready to leave – with Frank.
Gives his final instructions from the door—
KENDALL
Anything. Any indication. Call me. Okay?
(beat)

And look, this is gonna get press-released, but – by tonight I’m going
to be Chief Exec of Waystar.
They all knew.
I just wanted you lowlifes to be amongst the first to know, okay?

ALESSANDRO

Congratulations.

KENDALL

Thank you. Okay. That leaks, you’re all fucking fired!
He holds a serious face then winks – knows he’s opened the gates to the
story breaking. Smiles, heading out the door.
Off we go let the trumpets blow
Because the driver of the mission is a pro. The ruler’s back!
