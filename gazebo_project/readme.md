### Gazebo Homework
- For this assingment, only the graphic model of the robot was produced, the simulation of the robot was not able to work due to the world 
 not being compatible with the changes made in the robot file. However, homework instructions said that it was necessary to have the simulation running 
 rather just the graphic with the correct joints and dimensoins
- See screen shots of the constructed robot below
